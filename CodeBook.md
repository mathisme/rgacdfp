## need to also add how it was averaged and grouped

# Description of variables
* Subject -- an integer from 1 to 30 that identifies one of the thrity subjects
* Activity -- the activity the subject was performing at the time ofthe recording.  
* For a description of the measured data please see the original codebook [features_info.txt](https://github.com/mathisme/rgacdfp/blob/master/Data/features_info.txt)

# Adjustment to original variable names for the measured data
The list of original variables can be found [here](https://github.com/mathisme/rgacdfp/blob/master/Data/features.txt)
